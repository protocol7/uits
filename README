INTRODUCTION

    This README file describes the UITS_Tool version 1.0 distribution. 
	
	It is assumed that users of this tool have a familiarity with the Universal 
	Music Group's Unique Identifier Technology Solution (UITS). This version of
	the UITS_Tool supports the UITS Technical Specification, v1.1. For further 
	information on UITS, contact Universal Music Group.

    	UITS_Tool is a command-line tool that creates, validates, and extracts UITS
	payloads. Version 0.01 works with only MP3 formatted audio files. 
	
	This distribution includes the following directories:
	
		uits/       The project root directory
		  trunk/    The Subversion trunk
                        doc/          UITS documentation
			source/       The source (.c) and header (.h) files used for both MacOS and Windows
			test/         Platform-independent test files that are used by scripts in each of the
                                      platform-specific build directories.
			uits-osx-make/
				The Makefile, executable (UITS_Tool), libraries, shell script, and test files
				for building and running the tool from the Unix command line.
			uits-osx-code/
				A Mac X-Code project for building and running the UITS_Tool.
			uits-win-mingw/
				The Makefile (windows.mak), executable (UITS_Tool.exe), libraries, scripts
				and test files for building the tool using MinGW and running the tool
				from a DOS command line.
				
RUNNING UITS_Tool
	Under both Windows and MacOS, the tool is run from the command line. Open a terminal
	or DOS command window, cd to the directory containing the executable for the environment.
	For help:
		UITS_Tool help	   (Unix)
		UITS_Tool.exe help (DOS)
		
	The tool is also distributed with shell (or DOS command) scripts that make running the
	tool easier. Under unix, type ./runUITS.sh. Under DOS, type runUITS_create.bat or
	runUITS_verify.bat.

BUILDING UITS_Tool

   The UITS_Tool is written in C and has been compiled using the GNU C compiler on Mac
   and Windows (MinGW). It uses three open source libraries. Compiled versions of those
   libraries are distributed with the tool. To build in another environment, those
   libraries must be re-compiled. The three libraries are:
			OpenSSL -  (http://www.openssl.org/) Version 1.0 beta4 
			Libxml2 -  (http://xmlsoft.org/) Distributed with MacOSX 
			Mini-XML - (http://www.minixml.org/)
			
	To build under MacOSX using X-Code, use the xcode project,
		uits-osx-xcode/uits-osx-xcode.xcodeproj
		
	To build under MacOSX from the command line:
		1. open a terminal window
		2. cd to uits-osx-make
		3. make
		
	To build under Windows:
		1. Install MinGW and Msys
		2. Run MinGW 
		3. cd to uits-win-mingw
		4. make -f windows.mak
